## 📊 Project Summary

The analysis applies a full data science pipeline in **R**, including:
- Data integration and cleaning of monthly datasets (2014–2015)
- Feature engineering and handling of missing values
- Descriptive statistics and visualization
- Hypothesis testing (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis)
- Predictive modelling (OLS, Ridge, Lasso)
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
- Classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)

## 📊 Key Results Summary

- 📈 **Lasso Regression** explained 90.5% of variance in drug convictions.
- 🔍 **DBSCAN** achieved the best clustering quality with a silhouette score of 0.886.
- 📉 **Logistic Regression** outperformed others in predicting homicide conviction with Macro F1 = 0.625.
- 📍 Regional disparities are significant, especially in London and high-population areas.

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

- **Regression**  
  - Lasso Regression: R² = 0.905, RMSE = 47.9  
  - OLS Regression: R² = 0.845, RMSE = 44.3  

- **Clustering**  
  - DBSCAN: Silhouette Score = 0.886  
  - K-Means: Silhouette Score = 0.85  
  - Hierarchical: Silhouette Score = 0.35  

- **Classification** (Homicide Conviction Prediction)  
  - Logistic Regression: Macro F1 Score = 0.625  
  - Random Forest: Macro F1 Score = 0.620  
  - XGBoost: Macro F1 Score = 0.620

## 📈 Key Highlights

- Significant regional disparity in homicide and drug offence convictions
- DBSCAN performed best among clustering methods (Silhouette Score: 0.886)
- Lasso regression achieved the highest R² (0.905) in drug offence prediction
- Macro F1-scores around 0.62 in homicide classification tasks
- Extensive use of time-series and region-based analysis

## 📚 R Libraries Used

The project relies on several R packages for data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning, including:

- `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `reshape2`, `caret`, `broom`, `GGally`, `ggpubr`
- `glmnet`, `cluster`, `factoextra`, `dbscan`, `randomForest`, `xgboost`, `fmsb`

To install all required packages in one step, you can run:

```r
source("install_packages.R")
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onurtuncay/CPS-Case-Outcomes-Analysis.git
```

2. Open the R script in RStudio

3. Install required packages:

```r
source("install_packages.R")
```

4. Run the main script (after changing dataset directory):

```r
source("cps_case_outcomes_analysis.R")
```
